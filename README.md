# elevator-take-home

- I assumed that the only things on the elevator are people and items such as boxes or suitcases. 
Since item can represent anything with a weight and dimensionality, it should cover most carried items on an elevator. 

- I also assume that this is one elevator and single direction, if this was multiple elevators or bidirectional then I would have needed to consider the closeness of each request. I would have needed to implement a priority queue of each elevator.
